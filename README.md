Hey this webpage is a basic yet highly useful for tracking and reporting our personal and proffessional tasks we do daily. 
we can insert our entries and even store it locally or can sync with one drive .All the 
enteries by applying a particular filters for eg. this week we can export it in to both .txt file or a json files .I am basically 
using this to record my daily tasks in office and compile it on end of week and export it in .txt file and share it with my leads .Further advancements can be done to improve it .
